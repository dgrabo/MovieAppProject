# MovieApp Project

 In this project, I developed a user-friendly Movie Search App utilizing TheMovieDB API to fetch and display detailed movie information.

## Running It Localy

Open new empty folder in Visual Studio Code and in terminal type: 

`git clone https://github.com/dgrabo/MovieAppProject.git`
## Get API Key

Go to [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an account.

After creating an account, go to **User** -> **Settings** -> **API** and there should be your **API Key**

## Envrionment Variable

After getting API key, replace it in index.js file in first line:

`const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";`
