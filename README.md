# MovieApp Project

 In this project, I developed a user-friendly Movie Search App utilizing TheMovieDB API to fetch and display detailed movie information.

## Running Locally

To run the project locally, open a new empty folder in Visual Studio Code and type the following command in the terminal: 

`git clone https://github.com/dgrabo/MovieAppProject.git`
## Get API Key

1. Go to [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an account.

2. After creating an account, navigate to **User** -> **Settings** -> **API** to obtain your **API Key**



## Envrionment Variable

After obtaining your API key, replace the placeholder in the first line of the index.js file with your actual API key:

`const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";`
